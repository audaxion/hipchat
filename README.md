# HipChat

A Clojure library for the HipChat API V2

## Usage

Get an auth token from HipChat.

```clojure

(ns your-ns
  (require [hipchat.core :as hc]))

(def auth-token "YOURAPITOKEN")

(hc/set-auth-token! auth-token)

```

You can wrap all functions in a with-token macro if you want to pass your auth
token explicitly into a request

```clojure
(hc/with-token "YOURTOKEN"
  (hc/rooms))
```

## Rooms

List all rooms

```clojure
(hc/rooms))

;; => [{:id 325478, :links {:self "https://api.hipchat.com/v2/room/325478"}, :name "forward"}]

```

Create a new HipChat room

```clojure

(hc/create-room "Product ideas")

```
