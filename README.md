# HipChat

A Clojure library for the HipChat API V2

https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2/auth

## Clojars

```

```

## Usage

Get an auth token from HipChat.

```clojure
(ns your-ns
  (require [hipchat.core :as hc]))
(hc/set-auth-token! "YOURHIPCHATAPITOKEN")
```

You can wrap all functions in a with-token macro if you want to pass your auth
token explicitly into a request

```clojure
(hc/with-token "YOURTOKEN"
  (hc/rooms))
```

## Rooms

List all rooms

```clojure
(hc/rooms))
;; => [{:id 325478, :links {:self "https://api.hipchat.com/v2/room/325478"}, :name "forward"}]
```

Get a single room

```clojure
(hc/room "music"))
```

Create a new HipChat room

```clojure
(hc/create-room "Product ideas")
```

Send a message to a hipchat room

```clojure
(hc/message "startups" "Hi @user. How are you?")
;; An optional params hash can be passed in to set the color of the hipchat message
;; See the API docs for other params that can be passed in
(hc/message "startups" "Hi @user. How are you?" {:color "red"})
```
